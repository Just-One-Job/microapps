# Cursor Guidelines

## Deprecated Elements
- **NEVER** use deprecated React Native components or APIs
- Always use the latest recommended alternatives:
  - Use `SafeAreaView` from `react-native-safe-area-context` instead of `react-native`'s deprecated `SafeAreaView`
  - **IMPORTANT**: When using `SafeAreaView` from `react-native-safe-area-context`, the app must be wrapped in `SafeAreaProvider` at the root level (typically in `App.tsx`)
  - Check React Native and Expo documentation for current best practices
  - When you see deprecation warnings, immediately replace with modern alternatives

## Code Quality
- Prefer TypeScript types over `any`
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React Native and Expo best practices
- Keep components modular and reusable

## Dependencies
- When using Expo, prefer Expo-managed packages when available
- Check if packages are compatible with the current Expo SDK version
- Use `react-native-safe-area-context` for safe area handling in modern React Native apps
